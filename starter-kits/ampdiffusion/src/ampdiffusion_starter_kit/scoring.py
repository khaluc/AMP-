"""APEX activity scorer for ranking the AMP-Diffusion top-100.

``apex_mean_mic`` — mean predicted MIC across the 11 clinical-pathogen panel from the APEX
ensemble (Wan/de la Fuente), the activity signal used to rank candidates in the AMP-Diffusion
selection pipeline (Torres et al., *Cell Biomaterials* 2025). We use the **APEX-pathogen**
release (gitlab ``machine-biology-group-public/apex-pathogen``), which is the model that
produced the paper's reported MICs — it reproduces the supplementary values exactly, whereas
the broad de-extinction APEX (``machine-biology-group-public/apex``) predicts on a different
absolute scale. APEX runs in its own isolated ``uv`` environment (``apex/``) invoked as a
subprocess, so it never conflicts with the kit's ESM2 stack. Lower = more potent.
